# canvas-dark-stylebot
custom css code to import to canvas by instructure for dark mode and just to look better. (work in progress!)
this is themed in dark mode and making canvas look cleaner and is for canvas mostly coded for my school district, but you can still modify the code by figuring it out if you have a braincell or two.
for this to work you need to copy paste the code into stylebot, a chrome extension. there are tutorials on how to do this as well, and you can figure it out.
